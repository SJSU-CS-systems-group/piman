## What is dhcp.py?
This file is meant to create, offer, and assign IP addresses when given the MAC address inside the `hosts.csv`, created and located in the root directory of this repository ***upon execution*** of `piman.py`. 

## Why dhcp.py is designed like this?
Due to security purposes set from the team before, we must manually add the MAC addresses into the `hosts.csv` since we do not want malicious random hardware to come into contact with our server from the server room (since anyone can go in there as they please and add their own hardware a.k.a ***insider threat***). This is not exactly like a DHCP server and we take a few shortcuts here. In this server, we will either receive MAC addresses first, or DHCPDISCOVERY packets if the Raspberry Pi's are installed, and `dhcp.py` will send a DHCPOFFER packet to the RPi. If the RPi takes the DHCPOFFER (which includes the IP address), it will send a DHCPREQUEST and stop there and operate with that IP address - there will be no DHCPACK afterwards (this is the shortcut). For the MAC addresses in the `hosts.csv`, it must be added in this format:

| MAC Address | IP Address | Device's Name | Timestamp |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|B8:27:EB:23:89:E3|172.30.9.8|raspberrypi|1571097294

Each of these attributes are separated by **semi-colons**. In the first part, it is the MAC address of the Raspberry Pi. The second part is the IP address that the DHCP will give, or what the Pi will request if it was previously given an IP address from the DHCP server. The third part is the name the Raspberry pi (this will only show if you have installed the Pi, or has been installed before). The last part is the timestamp according to Linux epoch times. Therefore, all you really need is the MAC address and the rest may be empty or filled like so:
```
B8:27:EB:23:89:E3;0.0.0.0;;    

--OR--    

B8:27:EB:23:89:E3;172.30.9.11;raspberrypi;1571097294
``` 


## How does dhcp.py work?
Everything below will detail how each function works according to class and it's functionalities. It is ***highly recommended*** that you step through the code to see how it works and immediately ask for clarification for what everything does since the documentation may not be concise in definition. If you would like to see the packets being sent "live", we recommend executing this command below in a separate terminal to monitor the network. Please refer to the [manpages](https://linux.die.net/man/8/tcpdump) for more uses.    
```tcpdump -i ens4```

We are executing this command assuming that you have the following pre-conditions:

1. That you are logged into the Pi Manager's Virtual Machine (VM) via `ssh`.
2. You are using the *bash shell* to execute these commands.
3. We are assuming that `ens4` is the switch's (the switch that contains all the RPi's) IP address. Otherwise, change accordingly in `.env` file. If you do not see the switch's IP address please inform your supervisor. Execute this following command in the VM to verify:            
```ifconfig```

### **DHCPServer**   
#### Function: __init__(self, configuration)
*Description*:   
Initializes with the set up configuration. DHCPServer declares the socket to use UDP with `socket(type = SOCK_DGRAM)` and binds to port 67 (keep in mind it binds to all so you may end up getting other people's vlan's and other addresses). This sets up the broadcast socket on port 67 as well initializing the creation of Transaction object and DelayWorker object.

*Called by*:    
`dhcp.py` -> `do_dhcp(ip, subnet_mask, mac_ip_file)`     

*Return*: None      

| Type | Variable | Description |
|-------|-------|-------|

Related Classes and functions: [Transaction](###Transaction), [DelayWorker](###DelayWorker), [HostDatabase](###HostDatabase), [CSVDatabase](###CSVDatabase)    

#### Function: close(self)
*Description*:   
Closes the Delay Worker object as well as Transaction

*Called by*:

*Return*: (Type) Description of object      

Related Classes and functions: [Transaction](###Transaction), [DelayWorker](###DelayWorker), [HostDatabase](###HostDatabase), [CSVDatabase](###CSVDatabase)        

#### Function: update(self, timeout)
*Description*:   
Depending on the transaction id (client id) it'll receive the packet by using ReadBootProtocolPacket and will close the Transaction object if all files are done transferring and pop it from the Transactions dictionary. Checkout socket.settimeout in the Python API to understand what timeout is for.

*Called by*:    
`dhcp.py` -> `DHCPServer` -> `run()`  

*Return*: None           

| Type | Variable | Description |

#### Function: received(self, packet)
*Description*:   
Used for debugging to see if the server receieved a different message type from Transaction not listed in Transaction.receive(self, packet)

*Called by*:    
None     

*Return*: None      

| Type | Variable | Description |

*Description*:   
Checks if the given address is a valid IP client address

*Called by*:

*Return*: (Boolean) True if address is valid else False       

| Type | Variable | Description |
|-------|-------|-------|
| String | address | IP Address in String format with '.' as delimiters |

Related Classes and functions: [DHCPServerConfiguration](###DHCPServerConfiguration)   

#### Function: get_ip_address(self, packet)
*Description*:   
Selects an IP address after receiving a packet. If the MAC address is known from the `hosts.csv`, the IP address from the file will be given. If the IP address does not exist in the file, however, the request IP address is valid, then the IP address given will be the requested ip from the RPi. If there is no IP requested, then the server will assign a valid IP address of its choosing; however, if all available IP addresses were taken then it'll reuse and old valid IP address. At the last if-statement it'll replace the empty IP addresses that was manually entered and assign it a new IP address from the above options.

*Called by*:    
`dhcp.py` -> `Transaction` -> `send_offer(self, discovery)`

## Additional Notes and Citations
---
The following words here cite where the DHCP library and *WriteBootPacket* comes from when used in the DHCP. This library takes care of writing the DHCP packet and formating.
#### Python DHCP Server Library   
[Download](https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python_dhcp_server/releases)

This is a purely Python DHCP server that does not require any additional libraries or installs other that Python 3.

It was testet under Ubuntu 14 with Python and Windows 7. It does not use any operating system specific Python functions, so it should work when Python 3 works.

dhcpgui lists MAC address, IP address and host name.

This DHCP server program will assign IP addresses ten seconds after it received packets from clients. So it can be used in networks that already have a dhcp server running.

Contributions welcome!
